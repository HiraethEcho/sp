              that we may run a \$(K\_X+B+M)\$-MMP with scaling of an ample
              divisor which terminates, provided that \$(X,B+M)\$ has a minimal
              model in a weaker sense or that \$K\_X+B+M\$ is not
              pseudo-effective. Consequently, we establish the existence of Mori
              fibre spaces for non-pseudo-effective NQC log canonical generalized
              pairs of arbitrary dimension. In addition, we obtain several
              results concerning the existence of minimal models for
              pseudo-effective NQC log canonical generalized pairs. For example,
              we show that any such generalized pair whose boundary contains an
              ample divisor has a good minimal model. Finally, we reduce the
