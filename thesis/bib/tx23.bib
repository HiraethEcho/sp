	abstract = {Given an NQC log canonical generalized pair \$(X,B+M)\$, we prove that we may run a \$(K\_X+B+M)\$-MMP with scaling of an ample divisor which terminates, provided that \$(X,B+M)\$ has a minimal model in a weaker sense or that \$K\_X+B+M\$ is not pseudo-effective. Consequently, we establish the existence of Mori fibre spaces for non-pseudo-effective NQC log canonical generalized pairs of arbitrary dimension. In addition, we obtain several results concerning the existence of minimal models for pseudo-effective NQC log canonical generalized pairs. For example, we show that any such generalized pair whose boundary contains an ample divisor has a good minimal model. Finally, we reduce the problem of the existence of minimal models of NQC log canonical generalized pairs to the problem of the existence of minimal models of smooth varieties.},
