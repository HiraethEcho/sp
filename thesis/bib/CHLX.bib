	abstract = {By systematically introducing and studying the structure of algebraically integrable generalized foliated quadruples, we establish the minimal model program for \${\textbackslash}mathbb Q\$-factorial foliated dlt algebraically integrable foliations and lc generalized pairs by proving their cone theorems, contraction theorems, and the existence of flips. We also provide numerous applications on their birational geometry and resolve a conjecture of Cascini and Spicer.},
