For details, we add reply to each annotation start with "AU:" 

## about "above"
- page 263, "by above lemma "AU: Can this be changed to "Lemma 16.2.11"?
    - Yes.
     
- page 266 AU: CUP prefers not to use "above" and "below" in the text. Please replace "above" with a specific cross-reference.
    - "..as above" -> "defined by Definition 16.3.1" 

- page 272 "above"
    - replace "repeat the above process" by "repeat the process in Claim 16.3.9"

- page 275: CUP prefers not to use "above" and "below" in the text. Please replace "above" with a specific cross-reference.
    -"Above" means the two paragraphs above. Just remove "Notations as above", and replace "Then we have" with "With these notations, we have the following."

## bullets
All bullets can be replaced with (1),(2),etc.

- page 283: Please confirm whether the edits in the labeling of these sublists are OK. Please confirm if there are cross-references to these points in the text. If so, they should be edited accordingly.
    - Yes. In fact, with our template, they are labeled by (1), (a), (i).

## sublists
### page 271, Claim 16.3.9
page 271: AU: Can these four points be labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d) as they are sublists of (1) and may cause confusion.

This seems to be a problem caused by different latex templates. We prefer using (1),(2) etc, and (1.a),(1.b) etc for sublists here.
We suggest that only use formart (1.a) for proof of Claim 13.3.9 and "Construct Sarkisov links" in section 16.4.2, and use (a)(b)(c) for other sublists.

page 272: Can these two points be labeled (a) and (b) as they are sublists of (2) and may cause confusion.

 We prefer (2.a). Furthermore, the label (2) should be "(2.b)", since its sublist of (2)
### "Construction of Sarkisov links:" in Section 16.4.2

### Page 274,Definition 16.4.6 
AU: Please check whether the use of bullet points and numbers (1) and (2) are correct here.

They are correct. Maybe can be replaced as following:
(1) r_i:=....;
(2) Let \Grama be the set of ... such that
	(a) (...) >= (...), and 
	(b) ... is nef.
(3) Let s_i = max \Grama;
(4) Let ...

### page 279, proof of Lemma 16.4.8
The list 1, 2, 3 after "There are three cases." are still sublist of (1). We prefer (a)(b)(c)

## about "cases"

### page 272, remark 16.3.10
AU: It is not clear which cases are being referred to using cases "11," "12," "13," and "14." Please clarify.

- The label "11" is generated by latex, which refers to case (1.a) in the proof of Claim 16.3.9. Similarly, "12" refers to (1.b), "13" refers to (1.c),and  "14" refers to (1.d)

- "case 2" -> "case (2) in the proof of Claim 16.3.9"

### page 278, remark 16.4.7
AU: It is not clear which cases are being referred to using "case 11" here. Please clarify.

We prefer "in case 11" -> "case (1.a)" 

### page 290, section 16.6.2
- AU: If we are changing the bullet points in Section 16.6.1 to (1), (2), etc. as per my query, this will be confusing to the reader. Please check if this cross-reference can be rephrased to be more specific.
    - replace with "as in case $2b+2b' \leqslant 3\epslion > 0 $"

## others
- page 259, Please do not change the name Mckernan. Also do not change it in the Bibliography.
- page 262, Definition 16.2.9
    - There is a typo:  "then Z is a semiample model" -> "then Y is a semiample model".
- page 269 AU: The meaning of this sentence is not clear. Please consider rephrasing for clarity.
    - replace "Notations as in the definition of Sarkisov degree" by "Notations as in the Definition 16.3.5" (labeled by \label{sarkisovdegree})
- page 271 AU: Can "Section" be added before "5.4.2"?
    - In the original paper, it is "(5.4.2)" with out "Section". We prefer to follow the format of the original paper.
- page 272 "above"
    - replace "repeat the above process" by "repeat the process in Claim 16.3.9"
- page 280 "AU: Please specify whether "16.4.2" is referring to Lemma 16.4.2 or Section 16.4.2."
    - Section 16.4.2
- page 290 AU: The sentence seems incomplete. Please check.
    - The figure 16.1 should follow this sentence, and "Then D_0 ... " should follow the figure. The commutative diagram below the figure should follow "a decomposition of \Phi:X -> Y as'. Maybe you can replace it with "The partition of E_A(V) is shown in figure 16.1."
- page 292 short title of "Journal of Algebraic Geometry" is "J. Algebr. Geom."
